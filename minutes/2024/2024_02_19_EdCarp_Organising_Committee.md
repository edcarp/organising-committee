## Announcements
* Steven Ford is stepping down from the committee
* Giacomo announced steering committee meeting next week and that committees will likely be merged
* Alison Meynert leaving UoE and steering committee


## Discussion
* commitee remit and going forward (is seems like lots of organising happens regardless of committee meetings)
  * agreement that a plan is needed (there hasn't been much steering)
  * need to recruit new committee members
  * for now resolved to reduce activity (meetigns ca bi-monthly)
  * forming a community of practice (e.g. sharing know-how and network)
  * GP thinks it unlikely that university will hire a coordinator to help (Can we lobby for it?)
  * look for opportunities to pay and to apply for internal/external grants
  * reduce number of members and activity (e.g. bi-monthly meetings)
* room booking situation (in particular in central locations; GG reported it was difficult book)
  * library room are under IS, not central
  * investigate rooms in G.40, Lister building, Appleton Tower
  * there is a big room in the business school (need a contact there)
* paying instructors/helpers
* moving towards "software/data short courses" more broadly
* staying in touch: slack for chat, Teams/sharepoint for info, create a community mailing list
* organising instructor training w/o Carpentries membership?
* would still be useful to have a list of all workshops in one place (LM: running at least on workshop; GG: running multiple per year)
* not discussed but added later
  * EB: can we recruite reps in each school (they might also have access to local booking for some suitable rooms)
  * EB: we should document most suitable rooms and how to book them

## AOB
* see EdCarp report for more details of what we have achieved
* GP suggested to GG to organise an old-style workshop in November, look for rooms soon
