## Announcements
* Evgeni reported back on the meet-up on 24th February. The slides from the event are online https://edcarp.github.io/events/
* Giacomo reported that the EdCarp steering committee is meeting again. Alison Meynert is taking over as chair. The report on activity analysis will finally be submitted.
* Giacomo: DUSC going well so far, first round had good turnout. The June course will be delivered in person at the library. Bayes have asked for two rounds to be delivered in 2024 (Spring and Autumn) and have offered funding; likely to happen but needs confirmation of a coordinator role.
* Fran is leaving UofE at end of April for post of Deputy Head of Archives at Historic Environment Scotland. Will continue involvement in Edinburgh Carpentries, and has one more session in role as chair. Fran is going to try and drum up more engagement with EdCarp from UofE Information Services.
* Juan: organised data carpentry at Heriot Watt on 6 & 7 June through ARCHER2. One is also being delivered at end of April.

## Discussion: 

* Fran flagged AI as a priority in academic libraries's leadership groups, concern about keeping up with knowledge. Noticed there is an Introduction to AL for GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) in Carpentries Incubator. Looks like it arose from the Living with Machines project (https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/). Fran to contact authors. Potential future test offering through EdCarp.
