## Announcements

## Discussion: 

* Group each provided updates on recent activities.
* Juan and Evgenij: delivered software carpentry with Evgenij the week before the meeeting. Session was delivered at HWU National Robotarium - room facilities were very good except for small screens. Worth noting for future. Good attendance from HWU but not from UofE.
* Group discussion on recording of data - Mario to reshare sheet for recording data.
* Mario: involved in three sessions recently, including two DUSC. The in person event at the UofE library worked well but many attendees didn't realise it was online so dropped out just before. 8 attendees. Giacomo will be arranging similar DUSC programme next year (3 online and 1 in erson)
* Graeme: ran data carpentry in May and June but low attendance. Genomics scheduled for September at WGH, hoping for better attendance. Involved in DC genomics curriculum advisory committee.
* Discussed booking options: benefit of events.ed.ac.uk is that you get attendee info e.g. school, level of study. Eventbrite good for external sessions.
* Steven: discussed struggle to gain traction at Strathclyde and school's reluctance to bring in external / EdCarp trainers.
* Toby: welcomed back to committee. Now in School of Engineering and Physical Sciences at HWU.
* Edward: working on some lessons. Lesson on 'good enough' practices has made it through peer review and been approved for carpentries lab; designed to be delivered alongside GitHub lesson for first year PhD students. Other lessons have been submitted for peer review pending outcome. EdCarp steering committee discussed paying for Carpentries membership but decided funds better spent on admin support next year. SFC / Bayes programme is going week.
* David: difficulty engaging researchers and getting attendance at workshops.
* Evgenij volunteered to take on the chair role for the next 3 sessions.

## AOB

* None.
