Fran also suggested locally managed rooms e.g. Digital Scholarship Centre, Centre for Research Collections.

## Discussion: follow on from UK Carpentries discussion on encouraging new Instructors https://hackmd.io/@local-uk/S1XTCKwDo 

* Fran gave a recap of the discussions at UK Carpentry Community meeting on 23/01/23 and invited other thoughts and suggestions.
* Since working on campus, staff may have less control over their time and more management oversight of their activities. Can be difficult to make the case for time 'away' to teach a workshop. Similar issue for PhD researchers for example - their supervisors might not want them taking sigfnificant time out of their schedule.
* Staff also do roles where there is no one to fill in if they're not there.
* University of Edinburgh provides a Day to Make a Difference one day per year off for staff to volunteer. Not sustainable but it is something. It's in the policy here: https://www.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/special_leave_policy_gc_apr_22.pdf
* The group discussed the different dynamics of paid and voluntary carpentry workshop contributions.
* Giacomo has a report on EdCarp activity to submit to the steering committee, which will then be presented to the University to look at additional support.
