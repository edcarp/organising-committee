-	Folder contains instructions for updating the spreadsheet. 
-	Half the attendees form half the events are available.
-	20% no show rate.
-	Most of the attendees are Ed Uni.
-	Approx. 75% STEM/biomed
-	Different levels of information on ed.ac.uk attendees depending on students and staff status

## Comments:
There are no fixed requirements from funders on the attendance data.: it depends on who the funders are). Some funders need EDI datasets. 
Online workshop capacity discussed: 40-50 is the online capacity, but numbers are being kept down due to time needed to install the software. 
Some datapoints/row are single bookings of multiple workshops within a single event 
Discussed having a working table for attendance so the collated data remains intact.

EDC had organised workshops well, but recording data needs some work. The cdh.carpentries link contained a github based handbook proposed. 

Some discussions over Edinburgh and/or Scottish Carpentries name/branding. 
Files to be shared with committee members who are external Edin Uni users. 
Carpentries workshops planned? Graeme IGHC (the Unix, the R and the Git). Magnus discussed using notable to get round installation issues...there are visitor accounts that are possible.

Steve to organise the next meeting for early October. 

Gaicomo to work on a rota for meeting organistion.
