## Notes 

* Fran taking over the chair personship. Will organise
* Organise a meet-up probably in November.
* Juan talking to people in Belfast to have a software carpentry in December. Once Juan has dates he will look for instructors. Course scheduled for 5-7/12 for 3 days. Will include more content. Shell and make, python, git and SQL. They want to do a catch-up on Thursday. From EPCC will only be there from Mon-Wed. Chris and Juan are going.
* David is going to do a swcarp early or late Semester 2, putting out feelers. David will organise, hoping Sean will fund the refereshements. Hoping to get Tony or Chris Hill. Juan would like to see if this can be folded into an ARCHER2 course.
* Mario taught git at the school of maths and later at igc. 4 out of 6 registered attendees showed up.
* Steven - have been talking about numbers, when applying for funding numbers can be useful. Can we think of quality over quantity? Can spend more time with individuals. Had a discussion about how to try to evaluate quality - use of the pre and post workshop surveys. Maybe, where numbers are smaller one could do a bring your own data. Could experiment with the format - shorter and bring your own data or work on a real project. University researchers might get a collaboration and get a better feel for their data. Also, see whether get an idea how things work in the real world. Optimisation on ARCHER -
