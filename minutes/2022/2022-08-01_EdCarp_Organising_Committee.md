## Notes 

Steven did not get the zoom invite link. Mario should take more care!

Graeme:
* IGC carpentries - pencilled in Tuesday 27th September. MA or someomeone else
* R for Genomics will be used
* Was on a container course (docker/singularity) course provided by the ARCHER HPC is very good.

Juan said: 
* the container course is normally very popular and gets good feedback. 
* Plotting and Programming in Python is also very popular.
* Would like to run a Carpentry course somewhere in the UK by the end of the year.

Evgenij:
* could try to run a social event.
* ChrisW got an award to develop Carpentry-like courses from NERC, they may be looking for instructors.

Mario:
* Myself and Steven Ford are having a meeting with Giacomo to help organise a steering committee meeting.
* School of math are interested in having a git course having a call tomorrow about this.
* Chap from engineering was interested in having a Carpentry course but when he got in touch with the Carpentries they said that the UoE Carpentry licence was no longer active - not clear if the steering committee let the license lapse deliberately or whehter it was a lapse.
