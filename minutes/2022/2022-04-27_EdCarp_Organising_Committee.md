# Agenda Items

Minutes from the last meeting: https://github.com/edcarp/organising-committee/blob/main/minutes/2022/2022-03-09_EdCarp_Organising_Committee.md
I was tasked for setting a standing agenda, which I think should be:
1)	Approving the previous minutes
2)	Updates on actions form the last meeting.
3)	Feedback on workshops that have been run (for improvement etc)
4)	Updates from the Ed Carp Steering Committee 
5)	Information on planned workshops (calls for instructors, adverts for workshops running)
6)	AoB
