## Purpose

The Edinburgh Carpentries has two coordinating committees:

* **Steering committee**: mainly address strategic issues for the Edinburgh Carpentries and try to promote the Carpentries within the pertinent institutions as well as dealing with subscription with the Carpentries. ***Is there somewhere where one can get more information about this***?
* **Organising committee**: implement the vision of the steering committee and do the day-to-day running of the Edinburgh Carpentries - that is, they arrange or try to facilitate Carpentry workshops, try to source instructors and helpers as well as facilitating the setting up of carpentry workshops by providing tips and advice.

The remainder of this document focuses on the *Organising Committee*. The group is composed a number of volunteers who try to meet once a month. If you would like to be involved please email the chair person. There are two main positions who serve for a year:

* A **chair person** who chairs the meetings and schedules the new meetings. 
* A **secretary** who minutes the meetings and looks after the GitHub Organisation. The current secretary is to be assigned.

## Outstanding issues

* **Should we have rules for committee members? e.g. a minimum attendance?, see issue [#9](https://github.com/edcarp/organising-committee/issues/9)**
* **Running dates for the chair?**
* **Should we have a secretary?**
* **Can anyone join the committee?**

Other things to consider (maybe):

- Purpose (objects);
- Activities it can be involved in;
- Beneficiaries (who can benefit from your work);
- Geographic area you can work within;
- Powers of the management committee;
- Rules for running meetings;
- Voting procedures;
- Election of the management committee;
- Election of office-bearers;
- Financial requirements; and
- Winding down (closure).
